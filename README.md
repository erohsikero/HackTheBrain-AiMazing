   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file or use Cloud Run/Build environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id

## 🐳 Docker & Cloud Deployment

### **Build & Push with Google Cloud Build**

Cloud Build uses `cloudbuild.yaml` to build and push the Docker image with all required environment variables as build args.

### **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**

After building and pushing the image, deploy using the Google Cloud Console or CLI:

```bash
gcloud run deploy <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --image <IMAGE_URL> \
  --region <REGION> \
  --platform managed \
  --set-env-vars VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...,...
```

Or use a Cloud Run YAML manifest for advanced configuration.
